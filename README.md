# DS4 Audio GUI

##### Slightly improved GUI version of Ryochan7's DualPodShockNet.

### To be Improved

 - Play **system** **audio** on DS4's speaker well (*currently it's terrible*)

### Used Resources

 1. **ffmpeg** (for converting **.mp3** to **.sbc** file)
 2. **DualPodShockNet** (The system that allows communication with *Dualshock 4*)

*Thanks [Ryochan7](https://github.com/Ryochan7) for the DualPodShockNet.*
